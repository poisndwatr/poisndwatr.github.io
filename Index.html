                    <p>My name is Ally Wiegand, I am a writer, artist, and coder based in Central Illinois. 
                        I enjoy exploring and experimenting within and between the different medias that I 
                        interact with, which is why, for this portfolio they are all combined.</p>

                <h2>An Overview of Me:</h2>

                <p>While I hold a wide variety of passions, as you'll see below, they can all be woven 
                    together while still maintaining artistic value alone. There are stories and art everywhere
                    within this world. </p>

                    <h3> <a href="writing.html">Writing:</a></h3>

                    <p>Writing has been one of my longest passions. My minor in undergrad was creative
                        writing but I have explored writing since I was a child and wrote short stories
                        for friends to read at school. I write both poetry and fiction, sometimes experimenting
                        and blending the two. When I write I tend to focus on the human experience, emotions,
                        and concepts heavily. I think there is power in exploring and saying what might be harder
                        to. Go to my writing page to learn more about my active projects and see some of my completed works!

                    <p>Visual art is something I have dipped my toes into many times throughout my life.
                        I have always enjoyed exploring different methods and medias with some standing
                        out as a better way for me to express myself than others. I found myself drawn to
                        things like photography, editing, collages, fiber arts, and more. Visit the visual art 
                        page to learn more and see some of my work!

                    <h3><a href="games.html">Coding:</a></h3>
                    <p>Coding became a newer interest of mine, born from a desire to learn more and take
                        my work a step farther. Once I began learning coding an entire world opened up. 
                        With this website as an example of my exploration of website design, I also am 
                        interested in application and game design. Coding and designing allows me to combine
                        my art forms into something new. Check out the coding page to learn more!
