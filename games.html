                <h2>About:</h2>
                <p>Like with everything on this website, coding can be explored in a wide variety of ways.
                    Unlike the other things explored on this website, coding isn't often held in the same category
                    as art and yet it is. Every line is precise, there is a big emphasis on design in most 
                    coding disciplines, whether thats design of a website, games, applications, or the design of the
                    code itself. I have found myself interested in all of these ways of using code, this website 
                    is a show of my interest in web design but I am working to learn how to code games and applications as well.
