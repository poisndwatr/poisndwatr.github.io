                <h2>About:</h2>
                <p>Writing is a way to capture both the world and the people living in it. I love being able to create worlds and stories
                    but mostly being able to explore emotions and concepts. I think different mediums of writing are each powerful in their 
                    own rights. I enjoy the way that in poetry I can explore emotions and events in odd way focusing less on a world and a story
                    and more on a concept. For me writing poetry feels like making a collage, I am carefully selecting what goes where to tell 
                    a story and paint a picture. In that metaphor writing fiction would be photography or painting. It is still art, it is still
                    precisely crafted but it is bigger. Blending the two and experimenting out of the bounds they typically set is similar.

                        <p>Published in 125.1 edition of the Coraddi magazine</p>
                        <p>Why<br>Runs from my mouth<br>
                        Like it has become sentient<br>
                        And afraid of me eating it,<br>
                        Grinding it between my teeth,<br>
                        Hiding it under my tongue,<br>
                        And swallowing it.<br>
                        Because I know better<br>
                        Than to let it escape so easily.<br>
                        And it dances in circles around us,<br>
                        Your eyes bearing into me<br>
                        Like I am a criminal,<br>
                        The villain in this story,<br>
                        Not for holding the word captive,<br>
                        But for letting it even exist.<br>
                        And I try to catch it like a fly<br>
                        Clapping my hands around wildly<br>
                        Before anyone can see what I have done,<br>
                        Because if I'm not fast enough,<br>
                        Security will be increased<br>
                        And I will be locked up along with it.<br>
                        Sentenced to life<br>
                        In my mind.</p>

                        <p>Sitting on a cold white display,<br>
                            a light shines down on me, blinding,<br>
                            I don’t see the thought that creeps<br>
                            alongside the strangers approaching<br>
                            with a point, a smile, all the while<br>
                            whispering, “I love you,” to me, begging<br>
                            to scratch through the glass they see caged<br>
                            around me, they dance, offering their hands<br>
                            and knees, just hoping to be able to reach<br>
                            my heat-hardened skin, but all I care<br>
                            to see is the grease their fingertips leave<br>
                            on my clear casing, their smeared faces<br>
                            look up at me, unsettling, wondering,<br>
                            <br>
                            and I wonder what it’s like, to be made<br>
                            to be loved, my skin was once chipped<br>
                            away at slowly, meticulously, rough hands<br>
                            ground against me, and as I suffocated on the pain-<br>
                            ted smile, “sit pretty,” I was stuffed <br>
                            into my glass home to finally prove that I am<br> 
                            worthy, to be deemed as something more<br>
                            than a lump of clay some woman once threw<br>
                            together, it does not matter, as some <br>
                            woman once whispered, “you will never be<br>
                            Loved,”</p>

                        <p>Asseculae are parasites, they must drain humans of their energy, generated by love, to survive. Cas is the first 
                            Asseculae to appear in centuries. With no choice but to be a monster, because if they weren't it wouldn't just mean 
                            their own death, but potentially everyones, Cas does what they must. But what happens when the way things are always done
                            shifts? Does a carefully crafted reason to continue crumble? Do foundations fall?</p>

                        <p>"Claire’s fingers brushed over the paper on the floor only pushing it farther, unable to grip it. The movement of the bus jostled her and she huffed, pushing down harder and the paper was finally caught but crinkled. 
                            She sat up in the ripped bus seat, swaying from the change of position moreso than the actual movement of the bus. 
                            Nausea rolled through the tips of her fingers that traced the now crinkled paper. She should’ve just put the paper in her bag, shouldn’t have been in such a hurry to get on the bus as if it would somehow get her home quicker."
